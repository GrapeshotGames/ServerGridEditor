# Early WIP ServerGridEditor for Atlas

Initially created by Instinct Games. Feel free to edit and use how you please or contribute to make this better for all that use it. In the end it just is a quick example of how to generate the json for the game [Atlas](https://playatlas.com).

A fully web version or even another C# one but in WPF might prove better for your needs!
